// ACK is a measure for the long connection program to maintain the message accuracy.
// When you don't want your message to be lost, it is very necessary to maintain an
// ACK plug-in in the server. The ACK principle is to maintain a storage of SID unique
// message flag kV type in the plug-in


// WarnCall ï¼š The warning callback is due to the memory usage inside the ACK. A threshold
// must be set. This threshold can be set during instantiation. If it exceeds this
// threshold, the ACK needs to notify the program caller

// Handle : As ack is a basic plug-in, it should not execute the internal logic of
// other programs. When the contents of the internally maintained ack queue are taken
// out by the timer, a handle method should be passed into the ACK internal call as a parameter

package ack

	//Put user messages into ack queue
